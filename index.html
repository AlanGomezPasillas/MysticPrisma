      <h2> About us </h2>
      <p>
        Alan Gómez Pasillas is the real CEO
        of the enterprise, he does all the
        work that the company makes at least
        for now, he loves drawing, programming,
        music, innovation, creativity and
        nature. He wants to be a good person
        and wants everyone to be happy. Alan has
        born in Mexico, it was august 16th 2001,
        he used to play videogames with his
        father since he was a kid, that is possibly
        the reason he loves making videogames.
        <br><br>
        Mystic Prisma is just a small enterprise
        that wants to share art and good things
        to the world. Nowadays there's only one
        worker here, the CEO, we are planning to
        grow the company when we are able to do
        it and provide jobs to animators, graphic
        designers and programmers that are entry
        level, so they can have money from what
        they like and also learn about working for
        a company that has those needs.
